# Medical Image Classification with YOLOv8

Interactive Python project applying the YOLOv8 object detection model to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **Pituitary**, **Meningioma**, **Glioma**, and **No Tumor**. Developed and tested in Jupyter Notebook, this project investigates the potential of general-purpose computer vision models in the medical imaging domain.

## Purpose

Demonstrates the adaptation of real-time object detection models for use in healthcare. The project evaluates YOLOv8's ability to accurately detect brain tumors from MRI scans, helping bridge the gap between machine learning research and clinical diagnostics.

## Results

Evaluated on a 100-image test set with the following performance metrics:

* **Precision:** 87.6%
* **Recall:** 92.0%
* **mAP@0.5:** Strong detection performance at standard IoU threshold
* **mAP@0.5:0.95:** Moderate accuracy across stricter IoU ranges

## Skills Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience and strengthened my skills in:

* **Computer Vision:** Applying YOLOv8 to domain-specific datasets
* **Medical Imaging:** Understanding tumor types and MRI perspectives
* **Deep Learning Workflows:** Dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation
* **Performance Analysis:** Interpreting mAP, precision, and recall in a healthcare context
* **Reproducible Research:** Structuring experiments and results for clear reporting

# Instructions: Setup and Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the Medical Image Analysis YOLOv8 project locally. This project utilizes the Labeled MRI Brain Tumor Dataset for training and evaluating a YOLOv8 model for medical image analysis.

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RithvikBurri/medical_image_analysis.git
cd medical_image_analysis
```

## 2. Download the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Labeled MRI Brain Tumor Dataset" from Kaggle. Labeled MRI Brain Tumor Dataset

After downloading, create a directory named `data` in the root of your cloned repository and extract the contents of the dataset (specifically, the `Brain Tumor labeled dataset` folder) into this `data` directory.

**Note**: You may need to update the `SRC_ROOT` variable in `Medical_Image_Code.ipynb` to point to the correct path of your downloaded dataset if you place it elsewhere.

## 3. Install Required Python Packages

Make sure you have Python **3.9** or higher installed. This project relies on the `ultralytics` library, which will also install its dependencies like `torch`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, etc.

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

## 4. Prepare the Dataset and Configure YOLOv8

The `Medical_Image_Code.ipynb` notebook handles the dataset preparation (splitting into train, validation, and test sets) and generates the necessary YAML configuration file for YOLOv8.

Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially:

```bash
jupyter notebook Medical_Image_Code.ipynb
```

Execute the cells in the notebook, particularly those related to:
* Importing libraries and setting up directories.
* "Dataset Preparation: Image and Label Splitting" (which creates `train`, `val`, and `test` directories with images and labels).
* "Creating the YAML Configuration File for YOLO Training" (which generates `brain_tumor.yaml`).

## 5. Run the Application (Train the Model)

Once the dataset is prepared and the YAML file is generated by running the initial cells in the notebook, you can proceed to train the YOLOv8 model. Continue running the cells in `Medical_Image_Code.ipynb`.

The training command within the notebook typically looks like this:

```python
model.train(data="brain_tumor.yaml", epochs=80, imgsz=640)
```

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Organize MRI images and labels, splitting them into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Configuration**: Generate a YAML file to configure YOLOv8 with dataset paths and class information.
3. **Model Training**: Initialize and train a YOLOv8n model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Validate model performance and calculate precision and recall metrics.
